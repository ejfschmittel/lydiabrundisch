		Hi, my names is Lydia and I am a master's student of cognitive science at the University of Potsdam. I plan to report regularly on my work in cognitive, behavioral, and neuroscience research projects and to review some older projects. In particular, I am interested in memory, perceptual, and emotional processing, interindividual differences, and psychiatric and neurological disorders.
